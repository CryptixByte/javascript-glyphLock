# glyphLock C++

## Overview
glyphLock is a simple cipher program that takes a user’s input and scrambles it using a cipher key to generate encrypted string of text.

### Features
- Algorithm that parses the ascii range of 32 through 126
- Supports user-defined cipher keys (editable in the program backend)
- Prints encrypted strings
- Appends encrypted strings to the file _glyph.txt_

#### Development Notes
- Project started in C to explore basic encryption methods.
- Rewritten in C++ to address memory allocation challenges encountered in C.
- Leveraged Chemeketa Community College’s C++ program template, which handled:
  - Version control
  - Editor configuration
  - Build automation
- This Project Led to the creation of the other versions of glyphLock
